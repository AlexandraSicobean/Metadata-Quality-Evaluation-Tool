"""
metrics/plugins/property_coverage.py
------------------------------------
Measures how consistently properties are used within each class.

This metric is entirely data-driven: it imposes no external schema and
derives its expectation from the data itself. If most instances of a
class carry a property, an instance missing that property is treated as
a gap. That makes the metric applicable to collections for which no
shape profile exists.

Resources are grouped by rdf:type, and those without a usable type fall
into a synthetic "Unknown" class so that they are still accounted for.
rdf:type itself is excluded from coverage, since every typed resource
carries it by construction.

Score
-----
Within a class, the fill rate of a property is the proportion of that
class's resources using it at least once. A class score is the mean of
its property fill rates, and the metric score is the mean of the class
scores weighted by class size — so a class with thousands of resources
influences the result more than one with a handful.
